"""
SecretSpace sync server -- a store for encrypted vault blobs.

What it is NOT: it cannot read your passwords. The client encrypts the vault
before it ever reaches the network, so this process holds AES-256-GCM
ciphertext it has no key for. It never sees a master password, a Secret Key or
a vault key, and there is deliberately nothing here that could -- no password
reset, no "forgot my vault".

What it does: stores vault blobs, stamps each with a revision number, and
refuses a write that was computed against an older revision. That refusal is
the whole point. Without it, two PCs that both edited offline would silently
overwrite each other; with it, the second one is told to merge first.

Two APIs side by side: /vault/<user> with one shared token for SecretSpace
2.x clients, and /v2/ with accounts and sessions for SecretSpace 3 (see the
API v2 section below).

Standard library only, so it runs on any box with Python 3 and nothing to
install. See README.md for deployment.
